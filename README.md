## Usage Notes

1. **Rate Lookup by Address**: Use `Service ZIPs` to match a pickup address to the appropriate rate record. ZIP prefixes use "xx" notation (e.g., "956xx" matches 95601-95699).

2. **Multiple Providers**: Some counties have multiple ambulance providers with different EOAs. Match the pickup location to the correct EOA/provider.

3. **Emergency vs Non-Emergency**: 911 calls use Emergency rates (A0427/A0429). Scheduled hospital transfers use Non-Emergency rates (A0426/A0428).

4. **Total Charge Calculation**:
   ```
   Total = Base Rate + (Mileage Rate × Loaded Miles) + Supplies/Oxygen
   ```

5. **Null Values**: Empty cells indicate the rate was not published or not applicable for that provider/service type.
